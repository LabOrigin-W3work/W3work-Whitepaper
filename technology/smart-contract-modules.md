## On-Chain Social Networks Module&#x20;

On-Chain Social Networks Module is the smart contract to record and obtain the social networks among users.

W3work is designed to provide a bridge between Web3.0 practitioners and users, inspired by the concept of Six Degrees of Separation and the revolutionary practicality of LinkedIn, which is a Web2.0 Career Development Platform.

### Small World - One Degree of Separation&#x20;

Frigyes Karinthy originally proposed the concept of Six Degrees of Separation in 1929, which states that everyone is six or fewer social connections apart from each other. As a result, any two people can be linked in a maximum of six stages using a chain of 'friend of a friend' statements. It is also known as the six handshakes rule.&#x20;

The Web3.0 world is much smaller than the real world, which means that everyone may connect with one another in a much narrower circle. In the meantime, as everyone knows, quality connections are critical in Web3.0.

### Privacy&#x20;

A native Web3.0 professional might have different identities. W3work On-Chain Social Networks Module makes it possible for identities to be partially visible via different levels of degree connections.

## WorkID Module&#x20;

WorkID Module is the user identity module. Identification registration, asset confirmation, governance authority, and equity distribution can all be done using the user identity module. To avoid centralized misuse of rights, digital identities are fundamentally owned by users, not by any organization or firm.

## Decentralized Voting Module&#x20;

W3work's decentralized voting system is enabled by the Decentralized Voting Module. It allows for greater flexibility in the calculation of voting rights. Different methods of voting are offered to fulfill the needs of various organizations. To make it easier for project parties to govern the community, a user-friendly proposal and vote mechanism has been developed.
