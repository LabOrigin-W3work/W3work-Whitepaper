# üè¢ Invite Your Colleagues

The office owner or the lessee should collect colleagues' wallet addresses and input them into the Employee System, allowing them to log in and access the office by connecting to their wallet and approving a digital signature.

W3space provides a 'Chain-Less' experience, meaning multi-chains logging-in & interacting are allowed.
