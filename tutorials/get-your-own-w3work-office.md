# 🏘 Get Your Own W3work Office

> **It all starts with a resort unit in W3work.**

There are two methods for gaining entry to a W3work resort office unit.&#x20;

* You can purchase a **W3W NFT** at the NFT Launch or on the secondary market after the sale has ended.&#x20;
* Alternatively, we acknowledge the cost of entering W3work is a considerable expenditure that certain organizations or individuals may not be able to afford. To address this, we've designed a rental system that works very similarly to what you'd find in real life. You can rent office space from the owner for a long period of time with a certain number of ✨W3W, so that you could get access to all of the W3work services during that time. (Once the unit office has been rented out to a lessee / resident, the owner no longer has access to the office without permission.)

_**Having access to a W3work unit provides you with a foundation on which to develop your own Metaverse workspace. However, more crucially, it gives you access to our infrastructure, blockchain layer, ✨W3W and future $W3W token, interconnected community support & ecosystem, sophisticated Web3.0 social network, and anything else you'll need to prosper in Metaverse.**_
