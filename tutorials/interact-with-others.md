# üìç Interact with Others

* **DIM**: W3work allows you to send messages to individuals, to people nearby, or to everyone inside the resort area. To view any messages you've received, as well as to send messages to others, go to **Menu** and click **Chat**.&#x20;
* **Ring**: You can use the Ring feature to get someone's attention when they're concentrated in Pomodoro Focus Corner.&#x20;
* **A/V Chat**: You could choose whether or not to access your audio and video every time you enter W3work. When you activate the accessibility to use A/V, an A/V chat will immediately start when you walk near someone. The conversation comes to an end when you walk away from the person.&#x20;
* **Locate on Map**: The Locate on Map feature draws a dynamic line on the W3work resort area connecting you to the person you're looking for. Select **Follow** from the **Friends list** if you want to find someone without moving. You'll be driven to find the selected individual.&#x20;
* **Open Areas**: Everyone, including freelancers and indie creators, has access to open areas such as the concierge, announcement & advertisement board, golf court, caf√©, bars and etc.
