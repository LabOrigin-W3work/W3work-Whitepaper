# â›© Welcome to W3work

W3work Asset Management is creating the HeadQuarters in Metaverse, which is a unique virtual commercial space where users can truly own, build & construct, and enjoy working in their own office space, **work-for-fun** & **work-to-earn** & **work-to-build**.&#x20;

Owners of W3work office units will be able to work, connect, socialize, collab with each other, and participate in a variety of entertaining activities within the W3work Metaverse.&#x20;

W3work office unit owners will also be able to participate in W3work governance through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they will be able to exercise voting rights on critical W3work future ecosystem decisions.&#x20;

Authorized W3work developers can create digital assets (also known as Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs) and upload them to the marketplace.&#x20;



W3work intends to build a combination of casual and official business environment for Web3.0 individuals and organizations, including Web3.0 firms, Venture Capitalists, Indie Creators, Freelancers, Investors, and others, by offering Web3.0 decentralized social graphs, WorkFi Economics, and "Chain-less" experience.
