Owners of W3space units will be able to connect, socialize, collab with each other, and participate in a variety of entertaining activities within the W3Space Community.&#x20;

W3space unit owners will also be able to participate in W3space governance through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they will be able to exercise voting rights on critical W3space future ecosystem decisions.&#x20;

Authorized W3space developers can create digital assets (also known as Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs) and upload them to the marketplace.&#x20;
