# ðŸ“± DIM

DIM, or Decentralized Instant Messaging, is a blockchain-based chat service that can primarily meet chat users' anonymity and conversation records' immutability. End-to-end encryption is used for information transmission between users, and personal information and data are stored on the end-local user's storage, which cannot be taken by third parties, ensuring user information security. Users can do peer-to-peer instant messaging over DIM more quickly because there is no central server.
