# ðŸ’» Working Environment in W3work

You'll be able to communicate and connect with other Web3.0 professionals while you're in W3work.

If you find someone you wish to talk to in the open area, simply approach them and an A/V chat will begin automatically, assuming both sides allow A/V access. While neither party wants to continue the conversation, simply walking away would end it. If you don't want to be bothered by others, you might use invisibility cloaks to enable Ghost Mode.

You can host meetings, have 1v1 private talks with your coworkers, and have alone time to focus on your project while inside your company office.&#x20;
