# ðŸ˜Ž Work For Fun

* Rooftops and Central Parks at W3space are usually nice spots to socialize with coworkers and friends.&#x20;
* Users can also unwind outside of work by playing simple board games and video games in the office.&#x20;
* For freelancers who are not W3space residents, libraries, cafÃ©s, bars have been created specifically for them to enjoy a glass of Chardonnay, listen to music, watch movies, and etc.
* If you just want to be alone, there's always the Zen Room.
