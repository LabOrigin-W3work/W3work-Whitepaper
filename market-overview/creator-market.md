# ðŸŽ¨ Creator Market

There are over 60,000 Web3.0 creators (including but not limited to content creators, artists, designers, video makers, and influencers), not to mention Web2.0 experts making the transition to Web3.0.&#x20;

Web3.0 artists are estimated to number around 40,000.

In today's world, one of the most significant challenges for artists is the difficulty of publishing and marketing their works. As a result, some excellent projects go unnoticed while mediocre ones with strong marketing strategies generate incredible hype and make a big sell-out.&#x20;

Another stumbling block for creators is having little or no legal rights to the intellectual property they develop. This can lead to artists or creators spending days, weeks, or even months developing stunning content, artwork, or in-game settings for little or no monetary reward.
