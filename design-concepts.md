## Philosophy

We present the concept of "Futuristic & fungous & Equal & Co-Creative" based on the essence of Web3, which is to connect and empower everyone, and the demands of virtual offices in the Crypto area. At different dimensions of the W world, towns, communities, and houses, we retrieved symbols from the natural fungal system and showed high-perceptually visual representations.

W shows an organic and dynamic layout, as well as a diverse and rich urban community space, artfully establishing a strong connection between people, nature, communities, and the commercial Metaverse. The nearby communities interconnect with each other conveniently from left to right. The current complex of buildings, which contains eight distinctive office buildings with unique interior and exterior design, a large multifunctional conference venue and a world-class floating garden under construction, is situated in a section of the vein of the futuristic world in concept.

Thus, the activities of our residents are also integrated as an indispensable part of the communityâ€™s landscape. We intend to offer users a solid connection between present and future, natural vitality and future commercial & business while immersing themselves in our urban planning. They can experience the potential of future business environments while surrounded by the symbols of organic natural materials in the real world.

We wish to develop a modern, efficient, and immersive workplace environment for Web3.0 professionals by providing a distinct experience and vibe both inside and outside the office. To become a fully open place of connection and communication, W blurs the lines of workspaces between individual and collaborative, public and private, online and offline.

A well-built concept needs a perfect reflection. The vision of W is to Work & Collab & Connect in Web3.0. In the Metaverse we create, we dedicate ourselves to delivering our insights and understandings through architectural design, conceptual logic and aesthetic expression. While exhibiting innovative concepts, and integrating business culture, W presents an ideal image of a futuristic Web3.0 working environment.
