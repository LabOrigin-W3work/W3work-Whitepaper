# üôå Why W3work?

### A. Headquarters of Metaverse&#x20;

#### Backgrounds

**a.** As a result of Covid-19's consistency over the past three years, a growing number of people are becoming accustomed to #wfh, or work-from-home, and the habit of immersing in virtual environments develops over time.&#x20;

**b.** The boundaries of organizations are gradually blurring. Freelancers are emerging, becoming more aware of their independent employment, and virtual studios are springing up.&#x20;

üö© **However**, remote work shouldn't be isolating. Socializing, on the other hand, is a crucial component of everyday living.&#x20;

ü´µüèª **Meanwhile**, as Metaverse and Web3.0 become more popular, it shouldn‚Äôt just be a world of games and entertainment, instead, it must be able to meet all of Web3.0 future demands. For instance, the need for a dedicated space for Web3.0 professionals to socialize, connect, chill and hang out is increasing.&#x20;

ü´µüèª **Furthermore**, a huge number of indie creators are struggling to find a fitting team to cooperate with the release and promotion of their works in order to monetize them.&#x20;

#### Solutions

To address the issues mentioned above, W3work is being developed to serve as a **Work & Connect & Collab** platform for Web3.0 professionals, and for the first time, W3work has presented the revolutionary concept of WorkFi.

**W3work is being constructed to serve as the Metaverse Headquarters.**&#x20;

### B. Decentralized Communication&#x20;

W3work is fully decentralized, which not only maintains the functions of centralized chat programs but also provides security, privacy and encryption.&#x20;



Some of the most frequently criticized issues of centralized systems are security vulnerabilities, lack of anonymity/privacy, and monitoring technology. &#x20;

A/V chats are encrypted, and DID (Decentralized Identifiers) has been introduced in W3work to preserve user privacy and resist censorship.



Smart contracts work as logical routers between services and client apps, allowing clients to discover the location of the backend server for a certain room and connect to it using a decentralized approach. The W3work Router smart contract allows room owners to establish connection settings for their servers.

Anyone can use the server as it is open source. It's compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other operating systems. Room owners can utilize any cloud-based hosting provider, their own hosting infrastructure, W3work hosting infrastructure, and more to host their backend services for teams to use. W3work gradually cultivates a decentralized hosting ecosystem by separating each Room's backend server and enabling flexibility to holders of hosting backend services, allowing for the completion of linkages and associations among room users. The smart contract for the open-source W3work Router has been developed and deployed on the blockchain.
