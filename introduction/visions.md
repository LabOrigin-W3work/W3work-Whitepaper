# ðŸ›« Visions

We started W3space to build the first and only aggregation platform in the Metaverse that specializes hyping the communities and socializing along with entertainment. Each of the 11,111 unique W3space resort office units is constantly evolving and developed by its owner.

**Our vision is to make a difference in the present chaotic Metaverse by providing Web3.0 community members a deeply immersive Metaverse space to learn, work, chill, connect, interact, socialize, and collab.**&#x20;

We believe W3space will grow into a huge, massive-multiplayer decentralized ecosystem with a diverse range of business, social, and entertainment scenes.

* W3space, we believe, will be a fully customizable space for communities, with total ownership and control.
* W3space, we believe, will be a home where community culture created and strengthened by all members.
* W3space, we believe, will be an open-world Metaverse where communities connect & expand.
* W3space, we believe, will accelerate the advancement of Co-Creation in Web3.0. Everyone can produce content in Web3.0, everyone can be productive and creative in W3space.

**We envision a future in which every Web3.0 organization has a resort unit in W3space, every Web3.0 creator finds a partner in W3space, and every Web3.0 social network is connected by W3space.**
